                <h3>In history</h3>
                <p>
                    For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand
                    the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the Late
                    Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at
                    the center of the universe and categorically different from
                    the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky.<br><br>
                    The first exploration of the Solar System was conducted by 
                    telescope, when astronomers first began to map those objects
                    too faint to be seen with the naked eye.Galileo was the first
                    to discover physical details about the individual bodies of
                    the Solar System. He discovered that the Moon was cratered,
                    that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had
                    four satellites in orbit around it.<br><br>
                    Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by
                    discovering Saturn's moon Titan and the shape of the rings
                    of Saturn. Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four
                    more moons of Saturn and the Cassini division in Saturn's rings.<br><br>
                    Edmond Halley realised in 1705 that repeated sightings of a
                    comet were recording the same object, returning regularly 
                    once every 75–76 years. This was the first evidence that 
                    anything other than the planets orbited the Sun. Around this
                    time (1704), the term "Solar System" first appeared in English.<br><br>
                    In 1781, William Herschel was looking for binary stars in the
                    constellation of Taurus when he observed what he thought was
                    a new comet. Its orbit revealed that it was a new planet,
                    Uranus, the first ever discovered.<br><br>
                    Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres in 1801, a small world 
                    between Mars and Jupiter. It was considered another planet,
                    but after subsequent discoveries of other small worlds in
                    the same region, it and the others were eventually 
                    reclassified as asteroids.<br><br>
                    By 1846, discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus led many to
                    suspect a large planet must be tugging at it from farther
                    out. Urbain Le Verrier's calculations eventually led to the
                    discovery of Neptune.

                        Galileo was sentenced to life in prison by the Roman Inquisition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Copernicus’ heliocentric theory about the way the universe
                        works challenged the widely accepted belief, espoused by
                        the astronomer Ptolemy in the second century, that put 
                        the Earth at the center of the solar system. In 1616, 
                        the Catholic Church declared Copernican theory heretical
                        because it was viewed as contradicting certain Bible 
                        verses. Galileo received permission from the Church to 
                        continue investigating Copernicus’ ideas, as long as he 
                        didn’t hold or defend them. In 1632, he published 
                        “Dialogue of the Two Principal Systems of the World,” 
                        and although it was presented as a discussion between 
                        friends about the ideas of Ptolemy and Copernicus, the 
                        book was seen as supporting the Copernican model of the
                        universe. As a result, the following year Galileo was 
                        ordered to stand trial before the Inquisition in Rome.
                        After being found guilty of heresy, Galileo was forced 
                        to publicly repent and sentenced to life in prison. His 
                        sentence soon was changed to house arrest. He lived out 
                        his final years at Villa Il Gioiello (“the Jewel”), his 
                        home in the town of Arcetri, near Florence.
